Starry Point was a town on the easternmost tip of the United States, in Maine. However, in 2020, the town was abandoned due to the YﬂÅÁ§¸¥7F8ÈpOπÕ, with all residents fleeing to larger cities.
Two years later, in 0002, the town was rediscovered. With the advent of the ÀËeül†ø2&amp;lt;Yc_Y, it was uploaded to the Innernet.
Some physical buildings remain, such as the Starry Point Lighthouse, the Tunnelvision Arcade, and several homes.</description></item><item><title>Day of Inception</title><link>https://starrypoint.me/posts/inception/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 0002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://starrypoint.me/posts/inception/</guid><description>&lt;p>The community sapling has finally been planted.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Placeholder</title><link>https://starrypoint.me/posts/placeholder-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://starrypoint.me/posts/placeholder-1/</guid><description>This post is a placeholder, required for the site theme to function.
