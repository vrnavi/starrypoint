Starry Point was a town on the easternmost tip of the United States, in Maine. However, in 2020, the town was abandoned due to the YﬂÅÁ§¸¥7F8ÈpOπÕ, with all residents fleeing to larger cities.

Two years later, in 0002, the town was rediscovered. With the advent of the ÀËeül†ø2<Yc_Y, it was uploaded to the Innernet.

Some physical buildings remain, such as the Starry Point Lighthouse, the Tunnelvision Arcade, and several homes.

Please do not attempt to visit its physical location. The town bears no resemblance to any towns or cities that may be in its spot in other dimensions and/or worlds.
