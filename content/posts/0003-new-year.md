Happy New Year from Starry Point!

<!--more-->

`/ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE /`

This post is late due to the Town Council being on break.

Happy New Year to all who celebrate it in the Innernet and the Outernet. May 0003 be more fruitful than last year!

We will update this site with more content to follow later this year.

\- *Lapis Lazuli*, Town Manager
