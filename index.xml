Starry Point was a town on the easternmost tip of the United States, in Maine. However, in 2020, the town was abandoned due to the YﬂÅÁ§¸¥7F8ÈpOπÕ, with all residents fleeing to larger cities.
Two years later, in 0002, the town was rediscovered. With the advent of the ÀËeül†ø2&amp;lt;Yc_Y, it was uploaded to the Innernet.
Some physical buildings remain, such as the Starry Point Lighthouse, the Tunnelvision Arcade, and several homes.</description></item></channel></rss>
